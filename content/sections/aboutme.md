I am a Senior Research Specialist at the [Busara Center for Behavioral Economics](https://www.busara.global), Nairobi, Kenya. My research interests are in Development Economics, Behavioural Economics, the Economics of Education and Political Economy. At Busara, I manage Professor Johannes Haushofer (Stockholm University)'s academic projects in the fields of Behavioural and Development Economics. I have also worked with researchers such as Edward Miguel (UC Berkeley), Dennis Egger (Oxford) and Toman Barsbai (Bristol). 

I was previously a Research Associate at INSEAD, assisting Professors Michael Freeman and Chun So Yeon in the Technology and Operations Management field of research. Furthermore, at Singapore Management University (SMU), I worked with faculty on projects in Development Economics and Economic Forecasting. 

I obtained my Master of Science degree in Econometrics and Mathematical Economics from the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) and a Bachelor of Science degree (Summa Cum Laude) in Economics from SMU.
