    <h2 id="bio">Bio</h2>

<p>I am a Senior Research Specialist at the <a href="https://www.busara.global">Busara Center for Behavioral Economics</a>, Nairobi, Kenya. My research interests are in Development Economics, Behavioural Economics, the Economics of Education and Political Economy. At Busara, I manage Professor Johannes Haushofer (Stockholm University)&rsquo;s academic projects in the fields of Behavioural and Development Economics. I have also worked with researchers such as Edward Miguel (UC Berkeley), Dennis Egger (Oxford) and Toman Barsbai (Bristol).</p>
<p>I was previously a Research Associate at INSEAD, assisting Professors Michael Freeman and Chun So Yeon in the Technology and Operations Management field of research. Furthermore, at Singapore Management University (SMU), I worked with faculty on projects in Development Economics and Economic Forecasting.</p>
<p>I obtained my Master of Science degree in Econometrics and Mathematical Economics from the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) and a Bachelor of Science degree (Summa Cum Laude) in Economics from SMU.</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;">(with Chow Hwee Kwan and Yijie Fei)</p>


<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><em>Empirical Economics 65(2), 805-829 (2023)</em></p>

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><a href="javascript:toggle(0)">Abstract<span id="pubabslink_0"> (click to expand)</span></a><span id="pubabs_0" style="display:none;">: This study compares two distinct approaches, pooling forecasts from single indicator MIDAS models versus pooling information from indicators into factor MIDAS models, for short-term Singapore GDP growth forecasting with a large ragged-edge mixed frequency dataset. We consider various popular weighting schemes in the literature when conducting forecast pooling. As for factor extraction, both the conventional dynamic factor model and the three-pass regression filter approach are considered. We investigate the relative predictive performance of all methods in a pseudo-out-of-sample forecasting exercise from 2007Q4 to 2020Q3. In the stable growth non-crisis period, no substantial difference in predictive performance is found across forecast models. In comparison, we find information pooling tends to dominate both the quarterly autoregressive benchmark model and the forecast pooling strategy particularly during the Global Financial Crisis.

<h3 style="margin:20px 0 5px;"><a href="./pdf/EE_LSE_2022.pdf" target="blank">The Long-Term Impact of Universal Primary Education: Evidence from Nigeria</a></h3>




<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><em>Extended Essay in Labour Economics in fulfilment of requirements of the MSc Econometrics and Mathematical Economics degree at LSE (2022)</em></p>

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><a href="javascript:toggle(1)">Abstract<span id="pubabslink_1"> (click to expand)</span></a><span id="pubabs_1" style="display:none;">: This study examines the long-run impact of Universal Primary Education in Nigeria using a difference-in-differences strategy exploiting temporal variation in exposure of cohorts to the programme and spatial variation in treatment intensity. While the effects on primary school and secondary school enrolment and completion rates, literacy rates and formal school attendance to be large, positive and persistent, the effects on employment, marriage and family planning and health outcomes are found to be weak or even negative and not persistent. Since the effects on education persist even after tuition fees were reintroduced, school resource expansion is seen as the more important component of the programme. Boys and regions with lower Muslim concentration are found to have benefited from the programme more. The findings point to labour market discrimination and the Islamic institutional environment as possible drivers of the effects on employment and broader outcomes.
