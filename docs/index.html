    <h2 id="bio">Bio</h2>

<p>I am a Senior Research Specialist at the <a href="https://www.busara.global">Busara Center for Behavioral Economics</a>, Nairobi, Kenya.</p>
<p>Daniel is a Senior Research Specialist at the Busara Center for Behavioral Economics in Nairobi, managing Professor Johannes Haushofer (Stockholm University)&rsquo;s academic projects in the fields of Behavioural and Development Economics. He has worked with researchers such as Edward Miguel (UC Berkeley), Dennis Egger (Oxford) and Toman Barsbai (Bristol). He was previously a Research Associate at INSEAD, assisting Professors Michael Freeman and Chun So Yeon in the Technology and Operations Management field of research.</p>
<p>At Singapore Management University (SMU), he worked with faculty on projects in Development Economics and Economic Forecasting. Given his passion for research and teaching, Daniel is eager to pursue a PhD in Economics and career in academia thereafter. Through his research, he hopes to generate sound empirical evidence that can inform policy and academic debates. His current research interest is in Development Economics and its intersection with Behavioural Economics, the Economics of Education and Political Economy.
Daniel holds a Master of Science degree in Econometrics and Mathematical Economics from the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) and a Bachelor of Science degree (Summa Cum Laude) in Economics from SMU. He completed an Extended Essay in Labour Economics at the LSE titled &ldquo;The Long-Term Impact of Universal Primary Education: Evidence from Nigeria&rdquo;. His passion for evidence-based policy and data-driven research led him to pursue the MITx MicroMasters in Data, Economics, and Development Policy. As an avid learner, Daniel constantly seeks to acquire new knowledge and skills through courses in Economics, Machine Learning, Applied Impact Evaluation and related fields.</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;">(with Chow Hwee Kwan and Yijie Fei)</p>


<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><em>Empirical Economics 65(2), 805-829 (2023)</em></p>

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><a href="javascript:toggle(0)">Abstract<span id="pubabslink_0"> (click to expand)</span></a><span id="pubabs_0" style="display:none;">: This study compares two distinct approaches, pooling forecasts from single indicator MIDAS models versus pooling information from indicators into factor MIDAS models, for short-term Singapore GDP growth forecasting with a large ragged-edge mixed frequency dataset. We consider various popular weighting schemes in the literature when conducting forecast pooling. As for factor extraction, both the conventional dynamic factor model and the three-pass regression filter approach are considered. We investigate the relative predictive performance of all methods in a pseudo-out-of-sample forecasting exercise from 2007Q4 to 2020Q3. In the stable growth non-crisis period, no substantial difference in predictive performance is found across forecast models. In comparison, we find information pooling tends to dominate both the quarterly autoregressive benchmark model and the forecast pooling strategy particularly during the Global Financial Crisis.
