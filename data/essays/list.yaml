    This study examines the long-run impact of Universal Primary Education in Nigeria using a difference-in-differences strategy exploiting temporal variation in exposure of cohorts to the programme and spatial variation in treatment intensity. While the effects on primary school and secondary school enrolment and completion rates, literacy rates and formal school attendance to be large, positive and persistent, the effects on employment, marriage and family planning and health outcomes are found to be weak or even negative and not persistent. Since the effects on education persist even after tuition fees were reintroduced, school resource expansion is seen as the more important component of the programme. Boys and regions with lower Muslim concentration are found to have benefited from the programme more. The findings point to labour market discrimination and the Islamic institutional environment as possible drivers of the effects on employment and broader outcomes.
